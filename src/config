# Config file for Traffic Jam puzzle
#
# The file contains directive lines that start with 'W', 'H', 'T', 'P', or 'S'
# Any other starting character causes the line to be ignored
# After the first character (which indicates the type of the directive), there
# must be one or more ':' characters, between which are integer strings
# The directives should be as follows: 
# 
# The file must start with 'W' and 'H' as the first two lines 
# 'W' means board width, and 'H' means board height
W:4
H:5
#
# 'T' means PieceType - it requires three fields: ID, width, and height
# Successive PieceType declarations must have sequential IDs, starting at 0
# So a line 'T:0:2:1' defines a PieceType with ID 0, width 2, height 1
T:0:2:1
T:1:1:2
T:2:1:1
T:3:2:2
#
# 'P' means a new Piece on the board - it requires an existing PieceType ID,
# a left position, and a top position. A PieceType must be declared prior to 
# a Piece being declared of that PieceType's ID
# So a line 'P:0:1:0' defines a Piece with PieceType ID 0, at column 1, row 0
P:0:1:0
P:1:0:1
P:1:0:3
P:1:3:1
P:1:3:3
P:2:1:1
P:2:1:2
P:2:2:1
P:2:2:2
P:3:1:3
#
# 'S' means a Piece location for the 'solved' board
# The format is the same as 'P' lines - PieceType ID: left pos: top pos
S:3:1:0
S:2:0:1
S:2:3:1
S:2:0:2
S:0:1:2
S:2:3:2
